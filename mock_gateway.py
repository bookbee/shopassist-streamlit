"""Local stand-in for the real shopassist API Gateway (stdlib only, no deps).

The Streamlit app's chatbot POSTs to {API_BASE_URL}/api/v1/chat. This file
answers that request/response contract exactly as the real shopassist
FastAPI backend does (shopassist/api/schemas.py: ChatRequest / ChatResponse,
shopassist/api/routers/chat.py):

    -> {"session_id": ..., "user_id": ..., "text": ..., "source_channel": "web_chat"}
    <- {"session_id": ..., "response_text": ..., "agent_invoked": "OrderTrackingAgent",
        "confidence_score": 0.9, "timestamp": "2026-07-13T10:15:00+00:00"}

`agent_invoked` is always one of the five agents the real orchestrator
registers: OrderTrackingAgent, ProductRecommendationAgent, ReturnsAgent,
GeneralPurposeAgent, EscalationAgent — see shopassist/services/orchestrator.py.
There is no "ticket" field in the real response; on escalation the
Streamlit client synthesises a ticket number itself (chatbot/chat_ui.py::
_new_ticket), so this mock deliberately doesn't send one either — that
path needs to work identically against both.

Run this in a second terminal for local end-to-end demos:

    python mock_gateway.py            # serves http://localhost:8000

To switch to the real gateway: stop this process and, from the shopassist
repo, run `uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` instead — same
port, same path, same request/response shape. The Streamlit app needs no
code changes either way; only API_BASE_URL in .env decides which one it's
talking to (and both being on :8000, not even that needs to change).
